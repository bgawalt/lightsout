# Lights Out

Here's me teaching myself the basics of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript
trinity, using jQuery as the DOM modifier.

Additionally, some Python is in here to act as a solver. It implements the
game board and its toggling, and will use that to determine what states are
reachable from lights-out. This will be useful, in terms of being able to
only start games in winnable states, as well as offering hints on what move
will get you to the lights-out state.

I started this a looong time ago, in Feb 2015, but never really got
into appropriate shape for public consumption.

More to come!
